{"name":"BookSkateMate","tagline":"You're Cheap. So are the textbooks here! Be a cheapskate!","body":"The idea behind BookSkateMate is a simple one: help people save money on textbooks. If you sell your book back to the bookstore you recoup some of the hard earned cashed you doled out to get it. They turn around and charge your classmate much more for the very same book. If instead you can sale your book directly to him you can get more than the bookstore was willing to pay you for it. At the same time he will actually pay less. It is a good deal for both of you! At BookSkateMate we help you find each other.\r\n\r\n### Home Page\r\n![Home Page Screen Shot](http://robertawardivblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-05-07-at-9-57-51-am.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Book List Page\r\n![Book List](http://robertawardivblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-05-07-at-10-16-06-am.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Create Offer\r\n\r\n![Create Offer Image](http://robertawardivblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/screen-shot-2013-05-07-at-10-35-09-am.png)\r\n\r\n##Current Status\r\nThe Basic pages to create books, conditions and offers have been created. \r\n\r\n## Still under development:\r\n\r\n### Login Process\r\nThe creation of a basic authentication process.
