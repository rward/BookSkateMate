        <p>The idea behind BookSkateMate is a simple one: help people save money on textbooks. If you sell your book back to the bookstore you recoup some of the hard earned cashed you doled out to get it. They turn around and charge your classmate much more for the very same book. If instead you can sale your book directly to him you can get more than the bookstore was willing to pay you for it. At the same time he will actually pay less. It is a good deal for both of you! At BookSkateMate we help you find each other.</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>The Basic pages to create books, conditions and offers have been created. </p>

<h2>Still under development:</h2>

<h3>Login Process</h3>

<p>The creation of a basic authentication process. This is required to allow users to login in to the site and create offers and requests that are associated with them. Along with the ability to login user should be able to reset their own password.</p>

<h3>Search Offers</h3>

<p>The mocks ups to search offers and request shave been created but the must be fully implemented to actually function.</p>

<h3>Administrator Creation of books and conditions</h3>

<p>Currently anyone can create books or conditions. Along with the login process a role based approach to security must be implemented to allow only specific users to add and update the books and conditions.</p>

<h3>Links to Offer, Request pages</h3>

<p>The navigation links to a list of offers or requests for a specific book are not currently active. This also requires the creation of a page that list offers or requests for a specific book.</p>
